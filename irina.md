### HI! This is  **Irina** :smiling_imp: 

I am from Paris, and I am a computer science student at Disc Master of [LPI](https://learningplanetinstitute.org/en). I used to do Biology at CRI (It's the same as LPI but the old name, they changed it). I had a burn out last year while I was doing my first year of master, and I had to take one gap year to recover. I am redoing my internship and the open source course to validate my first year of master.

You can find me on *GitHub* by clicking on my name : [Irina](https://github.com/irinade) :octocat: 

`Here's some Python code to figure out if your in or out` :joy: 
```python 
#Trash code
if "cat" in "octocat":
    print("Meowww")
else:
    print("Congrats, you haven't fallen yet to the octocat people...")
```

*And here is an inline code:* 

`x = 3 + 1`

## My favorite equation is : 
h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x 

## But This one works ss well and uses Latex syntax:
**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
