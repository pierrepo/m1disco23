## Pierre

:wave: my name is **Pierre** :bowtie: 

I'm associate professor in Bioinformatics at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/en/). I like to build *algorithms* and *tools* to study complex biological data :bar_chart:. I love the :snake: programming language. I even wrote a [book](https://www.dunod.com/sciences-techniques/programmation-en-python-pour-sciences-vie) about it.

Here's some Python code with both `inline` and
```python 
# Fenced code
for idx in range(5):
    print(idx)
```

I'm also a father of two. I enjoy to cook at home, mostly indian-style food :yum: 

My favourite music artists are:

- Wax Taylor
- Morcheeba
- Les Fatals Picards

Oh and I really like animated GIFs  :grimacing:
