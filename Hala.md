**Hello**, my name is **Hala**, I am from Syria, I have an Engineering degree in **_Computer engineering and Control_**, I am here to learn how to use __Git__ and __Github__.

## In my spare time I usually:

## let's try to do a table with 2 columns, 1 header and 3 lines:

|Name   |emoji      |
|-------|-----------|
|Hala   |:nail_care:|
|Mari   |:cherry_blossom:|
|Tiffany|:tulip:    |

## let's write an equation now:

$$f(x) = x^2 - x^\frac{1}{\pi}$$

## Now we will try fenced code blocks:

```
Look! You can see that I didn't put code here.
```
## Now we will try inline code :

`Array.prototype.map()`
