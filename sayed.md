`Here's some Python code to figure out if your in or out` :joy: 
```python 
#Trash code
if "cat" in "octocat":
    print("Meowww")
else:
    print("Congrats, you haven't fallen yet to the octocat people...")
```

And here is an inline code:

`x = 3 + 1`

My favorite equation is : h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x 

# But This one works as well and uses Latex syntax :
**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
